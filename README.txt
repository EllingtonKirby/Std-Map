I was able to succesfully implement all of the given functions, but ran into a bug with the assignment operator I was not able to track down in time. My test file self_test.cpp includes evidence of everything I completed. I think if I resolved this one bug the rest of my code would be succesful. The assignment operator worked normally, but in the case of the test.cpp file it would become stuck.
